# Numerical Methods for Differential Equations

## Overview

This project presents a C++ console application that implements various numerical methods for solving differential equations, a core part of the Computational Physics course I taught from 2007 to 2010. It includes Euler's method, Cauchy's (Midpoint) method, Heun's (Predictor-Corrector) method, and the Runge-Kutta method. The application's primary goal is to solve a specific differential equation using these methods and then compare their results. This comparison provides valuable insights into the accuracy and efficiency of each numerical method.
